        <h2>Hello!!</h2>

          <h3>Design and Development.</h3>
          <p>
            I first started learning to code when I was 18 years old because I
            was so inspired by the people who were working on their computers
            like all the time and making cool stuffs that would work
            automatically. Basically I'm interested in AI.

          <h3>Competitive PUBG</h3>
          <p>
            Mobile games had always caught my interest and PUBG would be no
            exception. I started playing it by the time it was first released on
            the play-store and it's almost been like 5yrs since I've been
            playing it. So I've gained lot of experience and tactics. I'm
            undoubtedly one of the best PUBG player maybe in parallel universe.
